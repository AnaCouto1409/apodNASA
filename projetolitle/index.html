       <p id="titulo">Explanation: South of the large star-forming region known as the Orion Nebula, lies bright blue reflection nebula NGC <b>1999.</b>
           <br> At the edge of the Orion molecular cloud complex some 1,500 light-years distant, NGC 1999's illumination is provided by the embedded variable star V380 Orionis.<br>
            The nebula is marked with a dark sideways T-shape at center right in this telescopic vista that spans about two full moons on the sky. Its dark shape was once assumed to be an obscuring dust cloud seen in silhouette. <br>
            But infrared data suggest the shape is likely a hole blown through the nebula itself by energetic young stars.</p>
             In fact, this region abounds with energetic young stars producing jets and outflows with luminous shock waves. Cataloged as Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, named for astronomers George Herbig and Guillermo Haro, the shocks have intense reddish hues. <br>
            HH1 and HH2 are just below and right of NGC 1999.
            <p id="descrição">HH222, also known as the Waterfall nebula, looks like a red gash near top right in the frame.</p> <br>
             <p id="nome"> To create the shocks stellar jets push through the surrounding material at speeds of hundreds of kilometers per second.</p>

         <p id="explanation">Explanation: The Mare Orientale, Latin for Eastern Sea, is one of the most striking large scale lunar features. <br>
            The youngest of the large lunar impact basins it's very difficult to see from an earthbound perspective. 
            <br>Still, taken during a period of favorable tilt, or libration of the lunar nearside, the Eastern Sea can be found near top center in this sharp telescopic view, extremely foreshortened along the Moon's western edge.<br>
            Formed by the impact of an asteroid over 3 billion years ago and nearly 1000 kilometers across, the impact basin's concentric circular features, ripples in the lunar crust, are a little easier to spot in spacecraft images of the Moon, though.<br>
             So why is the Eastern Sea at the Moon's western edge? The Mare Orientale lunar feature was named before 1961. <br>
             That's when the convention labeling east and west on lunar maps was reversed.<br>
